**FOSSLight Scanner** performs open source analysis after downloading the source by passing a link that can be cloned by wget or git. Instead, open source analysis can be performed for the local source path. The output result is generated in [FOSSLight Report][or] format.

- **[FOSSLight Prechecker][re]** Check whether the [source code's copyright and license writing rules][rule] are complied with.
- **[FOSSLight Source Scanner][s]** Extract license and copyright in the source code using [ScanCode][sc].
- **[FOSSLight Dependency Scanner][d]** Extract dependency and OSS information from the package manager's manifest file.
- **[FOSSLight Binary Scanner][flbin]** Find binary and print OSS information.

## 📋 Prerequisite

FOSSLight Scanner needs a Python 3.6+.

## 🎉 How to install


It can be installed using pip3. It is recommended to install it in the [python 3.7 + virtualenv]([etc/guide_virtualenv.md](https://fosslight.org/fosslight-guide-en/scanner/etc/guide_virtualenv.html)) environment.

```
$ pip3 install fosslight_scanner
```

## 🚀 How to run

FOSSLight Scanner is run with the **fosslight** command.
``` 
fosslight [Mode] [option1] <arg1> [option2] <arg2>...
``` 
### Parameters   
Mode

        all                     Run all scanners(Default)
        source                  Run FOSSLight Source
        dependency              Run FOSSLight Dependency
        binary                  Run FOSSLight Binary
        prechecker              Run FOSSLight Prechecker
        compare                 Compare two FOSSLight reports
``` 
Options:
``` 
        -h                      Print help message
        -p <path>               Path to analyze (ex, -p {input_path})
                                 * Compare mode input file: Two FOSSLight reports (supports excel, yaml)
                                   (ex, -p {before_name}.xlsx {after_name}.xlsx)
        -w <link>               Link to be analyzed can be downloaded by wget or git clone
        -f <format>             FOSSLight Report file format (excel, yaml)
                                 * Compare mode result file: supports excel, json, yaml, html
        -o <output>             Output directory or file
        -c <number>             Number of processes to analyze source

### Ex 1. Local Source Analysis
```
$ fosslight all -p /home/source_path -d "-a 'source /test/Projects/venv/bin/activate' -d 'deactivate'"
```

### Ex 2. Download Link and analyze
```
$ fosslight all -o test_result_wget -w "https://github.com/LGE-OSS/example.git"
```

### Ex 3. Compare the BOM of two FOSSLight reports with yaml or excel format and check the oss status (change/add/delete)
```
$ fosslight compare -p FOSSLight_before_proj.yaml FOSSLight_after_proj.yaml -f excel
```
